# AWS Cognito - User Pool Creation & Setup

\*\* This article is currently in development.

### Cognito User-Pool

Let’s talk briefly about AWS Cognito.

You will want to create a user-pool and select the options that best suit your application. It’s important to note that you will not be able to make changes to your User-Pool after it has been created, so please ensure that you set it up accurately!

You will need to setup the following:

1\.       Select the Application type that best suits you.

2\.       Name your User-Pool.

3\.       Select the Options for Sign-in.

4\.       Select the attributes that you want to require from users upon Sign-up.

👉 **Tip:** Request more information than you think you will require – this will decrease the likelihood of you haven’t to create a new User-Pool.

Once you are satisfied with the User-Pool settings, click “Create”.
