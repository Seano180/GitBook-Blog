# About Me

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/SeanSheridan.jpeg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Howdy Git Fam ðŸ‘‹</p></figcaption></figure>

As of late 2024, I am currently working as a Rail Engineer at WSP in Melbourne Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º , where I design and deliver major rail infrastructure projects for local communities on behalf of the Victorian State Government.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring the tech space to advance my knowledge. Some of my standout achievements to date include:

ðŸš€ **Catapulted a Blockchain Startup:** I was part of a dynamic 5-person global team that transformed a blockchain startup from a mere idea into a $2.5 Billion powerhouse in just three years. My contributions spanned strategy, business development, team growth and training, platform bug finding, and UI/UX refinement. This platform has since generated an impressive $125 million in profit (figures as of mid-2024) ðŸ“ˆ.

ðŸŒŸ **Founded SocialPal:** I co-founded SocialPal, an innovative FinTech payments application on the blockchain. Since its launch in mid-2024, SocialPal has onboarded over 10,000 users and integrated more than 10 blockchains, revolutionizing the way people manage their finances and transact online. MasterCard has since followed in the same footsteps ðŸ‘€

ðŸ”§ **Designed Whitelist Central:** I played a pivotal role in designing and optimizing Whitelist Central, a Web3 DApp for creating tiered milestone-based contests with seamless social media integration. Launched in early 2024, this platform has already generated over $150,000 in TTV, demonstrating the value of innovative solutions.

From designing and delivering complex Level Crossing Removal projects at WSP to advancing developments in tech, I am driven by a passion for innovation, problem-solving, and pushing boundaries.
